## Creating Remote User Security Group and Adding Users in DC01
```DC01```
1. In your ' Active Directory Domain Users and Computers', create an OU[eg. Remote Users & Servers]. Within it, create user(s)[Remote User] and security group[eg. Remote Users Group]. Add these created users to this group.
I did created a seperate OU for this action.

## Configuring Group Policy to Allow RDP
```DC01 ```
1. Open Group Policy Management
2. Create a GPO, eg. 'Allow RDP Access'
3. Edit the GPO by right-cliking on the created GPO and selecting 'Edit'
4. Navigate to:  
Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Remote Desktop Services → Remote Desktop Session Host → Connections  
  - Allow users to connect remotely: Enabled

</p>

Still in the GPO, go to:  
 - Computer Configuration → Policies → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Local Policies → User Rights Assignment  
 - Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services: Add Domain Users or a security group (e.g., Remote User Group)  
   <p align="center">

</p>
  
Link this GPO to the OU where RDS01 is located.  [NB: I have moved the RDS01 serveer from 'Computers' to the OU created for Remote Users.  
6. In the Group Policy Managment Console, under the OUs, right click the 'Remote Users & Servers'. Click on the 'Edit Existing GPO...'. In the open console, select the GPO [ RDP Access Control]
