# **Domain-Join All VMs**  
First and foremost, and just like in the Step 4, on each VM (INFRA01, RDS01, and Client devices-CL01,etc.):  
   - Set static IP in the same subnet (e.g., `192.168.50.x`).  

This is a guide through that of INFRA01

## Asigning Static IP to INFRA01
NB: Make sure you are configuring the INTERNAL network interface card and NOT the External. See below configuration.  
1.	Navigate to this location on the Control Panel: Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center’.  
2.	Click on the Internal Network Interface card (the one without internet). A pop-up window will appear.  
3.	Double Click on ‘Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IP/IPv4) for another interface to pop-up  
4.	As indicated below, fill in the:
 - IP address:192.168.50.2,
 - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 and the
 - c.	DNS : 192.168.50.1.
