# **[DC01,INFRA01,RDS01] Domain-Join All VMs**  
First and foremost, and just like in the Step 4, on each VM (INFRA01, RDS01, and Client devices-CL01,etc.):  
   - Set static IP in the same subnet (e.g., `192.168.50.x`).  
      -```DC01: 192.168.50.1, INFRA01: 192.168.50.2, RDS01: 192.168.50.3```
     
This is a guide through that of INFRA01

## Asigning Static IP to INFRA01
NB: Make sure you are configuring the INTERNAL network interface card and NOT the External. See below configuration.  
1.	Navigate to this location on the Control Panel: Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network and Sharing Center’.  
2.	Click on the Internal Network Interface card (the one without internet). A pop-up window will appear.  
3.	Double Click on ‘Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IP/IPv4) for another interface to pop-up  
4.	As indicated below, fill in the:
 - IP address:192.168.50.2,
 - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 and the
 - c.	DNS : 192.168.50.1.

## Assigning Static IP to RDS01
Set the following to be the Ip configuration for RDS01:  
	-IP address: 192.168.50.3  
	-Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
-Default Gateway: 192.168.50.2 (INFRA01- Since the default gateway is the "next hop" IP address that a device uses when it wants to communicate outside its local subnet. It’s usually the IP address of a router or a server that performs routing or NAT.)  
	-DNS Server: 192.168.50.1 (DC01)

## Configuring INFRA01 to be Domain-Joined.
1.	In your left hand side of the Server manager, click on the ‘Local Server’.  
2.	Click on ‘Workgroup’, and a pop-up window shows up.  
3.	Click on ‘Change’, and another pop-up window appears.  
4.	Type in the ‘Computer name’ and ‘Domain’ name and click the Ok button.   
5.	Enter the Administrator credentials. After everything, you will be prompted to restart the VM.
