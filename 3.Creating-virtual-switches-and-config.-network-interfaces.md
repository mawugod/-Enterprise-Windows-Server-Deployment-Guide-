Let'set the individual VMs for proper communication. 
1. For inter-VM communication:    
   - Assign **Internal Network** to all VMs (This operation is done by first clicking on each VM and follow the below instructions).  
     a. On the right-hand side, click on ‘Virtual Switch Manager’. A pop-box appears.  
     b. Click on the network interface under Virtual Switches which might be set to ‘Internal only’. As shown in the below, under number 4, make sure it is on the right network interface, which is this case is 'Lab-Internal'.
