# 🛠️ Enterprise Windows Server Lab Project in Hyper-V
---

This is a full Enterprise Windows Server infrastructure lab from ground up using Hyper-V Manager. The goal is to simulate core IT operations commonly found in real-world business environments.

The setup included 3 Windows Server VMs (DC01, INFRA01, RDS01) and 2 Client VMs (Windows 10 & 11).

Here's what I worked on:
🔹 Provisioned and configured virtual machines (servers and clients)
🔹 Deployed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) with DNS and DHCP
🔹 Created OUs and enforced policies via Group Policy Management
🔹 Configured WSUS for centralized patch management
🔹 Set up shared network printing using Print Services
🔹 Installed and configured Remote Desktop Services (RDS)
🔹 Enabled remote administration via Windows Admin Center (WAC)
🔹 Implemented a backup and disaster recovery plan using Windows Server Backup
