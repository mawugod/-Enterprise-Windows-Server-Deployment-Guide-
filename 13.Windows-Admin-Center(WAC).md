# Windows Admin Center (WAC) on a client VM
This is to showcase that, you do not necessarily have to do everything directly from the Server but can use a client device to manage all Severs and Clinets devices.
## Install Windows Admin Center (WAC) on a client VM and use it to manage the following:  

```DC01, INFRA01, RDS01 and Clients```
Prerequisites:  
On the Client VM (e.g. WIN11-CL or WIN10-CL):  
- Must be domain-joined
- Must have network connectivity to the servers (internal switch: Lab-Internal)
- Logged in as a domain admin or an account with administrative access to the servers
- Ensure .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later is installed. You can check this by using the below cmd command:
  ``` reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Net Framework Setup\NDP" /s```

### Downloading and INstalling WAC
1. Visit the website [https://aka.ms/WACDownload] to download the latest version of WAC from an internet connected device,eg Host machine or from the INFRA01.
2. Log in to the client VM with a domain admin account.
3. Copy the WAC file onto the client VM and install. After installation. This should open the web interface for you like below. Go on and click on 'Advanced' and accept the certificate.

NB: Earl on, I was unable to add that of the INFRA01 and DC01. To troubleshoot this. I first got on the DC01 and run this cmd command:  
```Enable-PSRemoting -Force```  
And on INFRA01, I needed to accept a network configuration pop up.

Finally, they were added
