#  Backup & Disaster Recovery
Since I have already walked you through how to install various roles and Features', you should by now know how to rrestore them.'ðŸ˜Š

1. First install and configure 'Windows Server Backup'- Feature on critical servers. I will be using the DC01 for the illustration.

## Creating a Dedicated Backup Volume 
NB: It is recommended NOT to use the system drive (C:) as the backup target.
In DC01:  
1. Right-click on the Widows Button and select 'Disk Management'

</p>
2.Right-click on the C Drive to 'Shrink Volume'. Finish up with the Shrinking.  
3. Right-click on the 'Unallocated' space created. Follow through the wizard to finsh creation. I have named mine 'Backup' as shown:

2. In the window opened, click on 'Local Backup' in your left pane.
3. On your right-pane, click on 'Backup Schedule'.
4. When you get to 'Select Backup Configuration...' you can either select a Full Backup or Custom depending on the type of Backup you want.
5.  I selected the custom, since this is just for demonstration and selected the partcular folder to backup.

# Simulating a Recovery Scenario
Let's say the folders I had backup in my earlier demo was deleted or corrupted. I am able to restore it using the Recovery tool.  
This tool can be found in the same 'Windows Server Backup' feature that was installed and used for the backup.  
Let me guide you through the process.
1. Still in your Windows Server Backup, and in youor right pane, click on Recover.
2. You have two options to select from. And since we had stored the backup on the same server DC01, make sure the radio button is on 'This Server' and click on Next.

</p>
  
3. You are prompted to select the date and/or the Recoverable Items of the backup to use for the recovery.

</p>
  
4. Go on to select the recovery trpe. I chose 'Files and Folders because that was what I had backup.

5. Go on to select the items to recover

</p>
  
6. In the next option, you are askeed to select the where the recovery can take place(either the original location or anpther location), AND what to do if the wizard finds
the items in the backup. I have selected the necessary option as shown in the snapshot below. Yours might be different.

</p>
  
7. Go on with the recovery process. Close it and go to where you opted for it to be restored.  
I chose Desktop and as shown, I have the both the folder that was backup and the one that was restored.
